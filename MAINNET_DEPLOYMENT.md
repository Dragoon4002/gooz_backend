# üöÄ Mainnet Deployment Guide - MonopolyGameEscrow

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to mainnet, ensure ALL items are completed:

---

## üìã 1. Smart Contract Requirements

### ‚úÖ Security Audit
- [ ] **Professional security audit completed** (Highly Recommended)
  - CertiK, OpenZeppelin, ConsenSys Diligence, or similar
  - Cost: $5,000 - $50,000 depending on auditor
  - Timeline: 2-4 weeks
  - **Why:** Protect user funds from vulnerabilities

- [ ] **Internal security review completed**
  - Review all functions
  - Check for reentrancy vulnerabilities ‚úÖ (already protected)
  - Verify access controls ‚úÖ (onlyOwner in place)
  - Test edge cases

### ‚úÖ Testing Coverage
- [ ] **Testnet testing completed** (100+ transactions)
  - All deposit scenarios tested
  - Prize distribution tested with different rankings
  - Emergency withdrawal tested
  - Edge cases tested (duplicate players, insufficient funds, etc.)

- [ ] **Load testing completed**
  - Multiple concurrent games
  - High transaction volume
  - Network congestion scenarios

### ‚úÖ Contract Configuration Review

Current configuration (Line 28-33 in finalContractOptimized.sol):
```solidity
uint256 public constant ENTRY_FEE = 1 ether;
uint256 public constant TOTAL_PLAYERS = 4;
uint256 private constant WINNER_PRIZE = 2 ether;
uint256 private constant FIRST_RUNNER_PRIZE = 1 ether;
uint256 private constant SECOND_RUNNER_PRIZE = 0.5 ether;
```

**IMPORTANT DECISION:**
- [ ] **Entry fee amount confirmed**
  - Current: 1 U2U per player
  - On U2U mainnet: Check current U2U price in USD
  - Example: If 1 U2U = $10, entry fee = $10/player = $40/game
  - **‚ö†Ô∏è This CANNOT be changed after deployment!**

- [ ] **Prize distribution confirmed**
  - Winner: 2 U2U (50%)
  - 1st Runner: 1 U2U (25%)
  - 2nd Runner: 0.5 U2U (12.5%)
  - Loser: 0 U2U (0%)
  - Creator: 0.5 U2U (12.5%)
  - **Total: 100% of pool**

---

## üîê 2. Wallet Security

### ‚úÖ Owner Wallet (Controls Prize Distribution)

- [ ] **Use hardware wallet or multi-sig**
  - Recommended: Gnosis Safe multi-sig (2-of-3 or 3-of-5)
  - Alternative: Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet
  - **Never use a hot wallet for mainnet owner!**

- [ ] **Owner wallet funded**
  - Minimum 10 U2U for gas fees
  - Recommended: 50 U2U buffer

- [ ] **Backup and recovery plan**
  - Seed phrase stored securely (metal backup, safe deposit box)
  - Multiple trusted people know recovery process
  - Test recovery process on testnet

### ‚úÖ Creator Wallet (Receives Profits)

- [ ] **Creator wallet address confirmed**
  - Current: `0xc4236361E8dD2c1691225090e04e6E45fffbf412`
  - Verify this is correct for mainnet
  - Can be changed later by owner via `setCreatorWallet()`

- [ ] **Creator wallet accessible**
  - Ensure you have access to this wallet
  - Test receiving funds on testnet

---

## üåê 3. Network Configuration

### ‚úÖ U2U Mainnet Details

Update your `.env` for mainnet:

```bash
# ============ MAINNET CONFIGURATION ============

# Network
RPC_URL=https://rpc-mainnet.u2u.xyz  # VERIFY THIS URL!
CHAIN_ID=39  # VERIFY THIS!

# Owner (use hardware wallet or multi-sig)
PRIVATE_KEY=<SECURE_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY>

# Creator wallet (receives profits)
CREATOR_WALLET=0x<YOUR_CREATOR_WALLET_ADDRESS>

# Contract (will be filled after deployment)
FINAL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>

# ============ DO NOT INCLUDE PLAYER KEYS ON MAINNET ============
# Players will sign with their own wallets (MetaMask)
# DO NOT STORE PLAYER PRIVATE KEYS ON BACKEND!
```

**Required Information:**
- [ ] **U2U Mainnet RPC URL verified**
  - Check official U2U documentation
  - Test RPC connection: `curl https://rpc-mainnet.u2u.xyz`

- [ ] **U2U Mainnet Chain ID verified**

  - Verify in U2U docs: https://docs.u2u.xyz

- [ ] **Block explorer URL confirmed**
  - For transaction verification
  - Example: https://explorer.u2u.xyz

---

## üí∞ 4. Financial Requirements

### ‚úÖ Deployment Costs

- [ ] **Gas fees for deployment**
  - Estimated: 0.5 - 1 U2U
  - Owner wallet needs this amount

- [ ] **Operational reserves**
  - Gas for prize distributions: ~0.05 U2U per game
  - Minimum reserve: 50 U2U
  - Recommended: 100+ U2U

### ‚úÖ Economic Model Validation

- [ ] **Entry fee economics verified**
  - Current: 1 U2U = $X USD (check market price)
  - Is this price attractive to players?
  - Competitive with other games?

- [ ] **Creator revenue projections**
  - Creator receives: 12.5% per game (0.5 U2U)
  - Expected games per day: ?
  - Monthly revenue: ?
